### Running an experiment

To run the experiment, at first you have to run an instance of mlflow, exposed to a particular port and host address. Then you have to set up the environmental variable if you are working on Windows OS and finally run command with proper settings e.g.:

```
mlflow ui -p 5000 -h 0.0.0.0
$Env:CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=":4096:8"
python -m src.train_model -d stellar
```
